## netflow simulator is built on two parts a publisher that publish mocked fake network packets with different protocols and publish it using tcp to a consumer tha tthis consumer mergesort the incomign packets base on ip and sum the numerical fields and after a while give a statical report about top five incoming packets , top five outgoing ips , which ips had increase traffic during time and create a chart for the flow of that ip, for summing this large amount of records we use simd and vectorization techniques
